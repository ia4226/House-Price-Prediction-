# House-Price-Prediction
This repository hosts a comprehensive project on predicting house prices using a dataset of California housing with various attributes. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides a rich set of features related to housing properties, making it an ideal foundation for predictive modeling.

Key Features:
-Dataset Source: The project leverages a CSV file sourced from Kaggle, containing detailed information on California house prices. This dataset is carefully selected for its diversity and relevance to the task of predicting housing values.

-Predictive Modeling: Utilizing machine learning techniques, particularly regression algorithms, the project aims to build robust models for predicting house prices based on the provided attributes. The primary focus is on deploying effective algorithms like XGBoost, leveraging scikit-learn for model evaluation, and fine-tuning the models for optimal performance.

-Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The repository includes Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts showcasing the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process. It covers data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, and visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.

-Documentation: The project is well-documented, providing clear explanations of the code, methodology, and model evaluations. This ensures that users, whether they are developers, data scientists, or enthusiasts, can easily understand and extend the work.

-Reproducibility: Emphasis is placed on reproducibility. Users can easily replicate the experiments, tweak the parameters, or apply the techniques to their own datasets.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and utilize this repository to enhance your understanding of house price prediction or as a starting point for your own predictive modeling projects. Your feedback and contributions are highly encouraged!
